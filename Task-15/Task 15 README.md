# Statistical Calculations 

This project demonstrates how to compute basic statistical measures using modern  features It calculates:
-  Mean
-  Median
-  Variance
-  Standard Deviation

# Features

- Uses std::vector for dynamic data storage
- Utilizes STL algorithms like std::accumulate and std::sort
- Applies modern C++17 features: auto, range-based loops, and structured code

# Sample Output

Input values: 19.8 48 30.2 25.4 15.7 
Mean: 27.82
Median: 25.4
Variance: 125.994
Standard Deviation: 11.2247
